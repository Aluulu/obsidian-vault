Linux is an open-source and Unix-like operating system kernel. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since become a fundamental part of many different software distributions, commonly referred to as Linux distributions or simply "Linux distros."

The Linux kernel provides essential functionalities such as process management, memory management, hardware abstraction, and device drivers, which allow software applications to interact with computer hardware. It forms the foundation upon which complete operating systems are built.

Linux distributions combine the Linux kernel with a collection of software packages, including libraries, utilities, graphical interfaces, and application software. Some popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Arch Linux, and many others.

Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It is widely used in various environments, ranging from servers and supercomputers to desktop computers, embedded systems, smartphones, and even IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Additionally, Linux has a strong community of developers and enthusiasts who contribute to its development and support, making it a vibrant and evolving ecosystem.
