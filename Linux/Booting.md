# Boot loader

The default boot loader for any system should be GRUB (GRand Unified Boot loader). There are two versions of GRUB, GRUB Legacy and GRUB 2. GRUB 2 is the standard, and should be the only one used.

## GRUB config file

The GRUB config file is called grub.cfg, and it is typically kept in `/boot/grub` or `/boot/grub2`.

> [!important] Important
> Most systems may regenerate grub.cfg during typical running, so take steps to ensure your handcrafted grub.cfg file doesn't get removed 

You can create the config file yourself, but it is typically generated by the `grub-mkconfig` or `grub2-mkconfig` (RHEL and CentOS) commands.

# Check UEFI boot order

Run the following command to see the current UEFI boot order:

```Shell
efibootmgr -v
```

# Kernal options and paramters

## Check kernal parameters on boot

You can check the parameters your system was booted up with by running the following command:

```Shell
cat /proc/cmdline
```

## Edit Kernal options

To edit the appropriate file in either `/etc/grub.d/40_custom` or `/etc/defaults/grub`. If editing the later, the variable `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` should be edited. For example:

`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="nvidia_drm.modeset=1"`

# System management daemon

A system management daemon is a daemon that handles the system settings and services. Systemd is the most used. To learn more about systemd, check out the [[Systemd]] page.

Systemd and init both do the same job, but in different ways. Init an older version, while systemd is the newer contender that aims to be better than init. Systemd is used because it is more advanced, and because it covers a wider range of systems and services.

> [!notes]
> There is an argument to be made for which system manager is better. For a better understanding, read "**UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook - Fifth Edition**". **Chapter 2.6** under the heading `Traditional init` and `systemd vs. the world`

For booting, systemd is important because programs depend on it to run at startup, and to handle dependecies for it. For more information, look at the section for displaying all installed units and their status in [[Systemd#Show all unit services and status]] ![[Systemd#Show all unit services and status]]

Another use heading is targets, which show the states that your system can can go into. This can range from a recovery mode, a network-less commandline state, to the default state. Find out more here: [[Systemd#Targets]]
